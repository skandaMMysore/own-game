On gameState Money, I should ask a logic for displaying the coins took above max range
line 1565
working on lines 1128 and all the codes must be copied and pasted here
dollar111,112,bk,bk2
make all bk and bs as set of global variables in setup() and so they can be made their visibility to false in certain conditions
all 4 functions for bullets got created 
what I should ask:
1. About the backpack problem
2. whether functions written are correct or not
3. movement problem and parachute problem

make the variables global and create the sprite in previously play condition

code is written but is not functioning properly
